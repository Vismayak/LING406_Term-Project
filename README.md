# Sentiment Classifier

This project was undertaken initially as a part of my Linguistics class but my interest in the subject made me create a few additional models in order to classify the reviews better. The aim of the project was to distinguish between the positive and negative reviews in a Yelp and IMDB. An interesting side project I undertook was to train a model on Yelp reviews(primarily deals with restaurants), then test it on IMDB reviews (primarily deals with TV and movies) and vice versa.
